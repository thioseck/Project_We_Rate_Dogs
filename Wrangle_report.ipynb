    "First, we downloaded the WeRateDogs archive twitter_archive_enchanced.csv file manually by clicking the link provided by Udacity.<br>\n",
    "Second, The tweet image _prediction.tsv file was available on Udacity's server. We dowloaded the fie using request library.<br>\n",
    "Third, using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs thwitter archive. We supposed to query the twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using python tweepy library and stored each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt. Unfotunally, we were not able to obtain an API key to do that. We used the tweet_json.txt provided by Udacity."

    "+ Replies related columns are not really needed. <br>\n",
    "+ Column 'name' does not follow the rules.<br>\n",
    "+ Convert tweet_id to string.<br>\n",
    "+ Convert timestamp to datetime. <br>\n",
    "+ Rating numerator value equal 1776 is an outlier. <br>\n",
    "+ Delete all rating numerator value superior at 20.\n",
    "+ Numerators  and denominator equal at 20 or less are acceptable.   \n",

    "+ Capitalize all words founds in columns p1, p2 and p3.<br>\n",

    "+ Merge all dataframes in one by tweet_id.\n",
    "+ Doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo are one variable spread across different     columns\n",
    "+ rating_numerator and rating_denominator can be combined into one column \n",
